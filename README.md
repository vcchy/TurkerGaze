### Usage

0. See a demo
	0. Setup a local web server, download the folder, open 'pugazetrackr.html' to run the eye tracking task. Save the result data to a local file and visualize the result by 'visualizer.html'.
	0. You can also try it here:
	[eye tracking task](http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/pugazetrackr.html)
	[visualization](http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/visualizer.html)


0. User your own images
	0. Create a .json object with two fields: 'gaze' and 'memory' like './demo/imglist.json'. 'gaze' contains the images that you want to present for free-viewing, and 'memory' contains images for the memory test.
	0. Pass the path of this .json file by url parameter 'imglist'. For example, http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/pugazetrackr.html?imglist=your_imglist_url
	0. Run the task!
